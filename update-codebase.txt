To prepare for a real-world demo, **do not start from scratch.** Your current CSS and page structure are already 80% there. Instead, you need a "High-Fidelity Update" to your existing codebase to remove the "teleportation" shortcuts.

Here is the technical objective and the specific update plan you can provide to your coding agent (GitHub Copilot or Codex):

***

### **Technical Objective: SAP ECC6 Practice Harness Refactoring**

**Goal:** Transform a linear demo mockup into a non-linear practice environment that forces a Copilot Studio agent to handle real SAP ECC6 navigation patterns (Initial Screens, Toolbar Icons, and OK-Codes).

**Why:** The agent must learn the "Initial Screen" pattern (typing a User ID and clicking a toolbar icon) so it doesn't fail when it hits the customer's real system.

***

### **The "Update" Specification (Paste this to your coding agent)**

#### **1. Add the "SU01 Initial Screen" (`su01-initial.html`)**
This is the most critical update. 
- **The UI:** Create a page with a single input field labeled **"User"** and a standard SAP top toolbar.
- **The Toolbar:** Must include three distinct icons:
    - **Pencil (Change):** Navigates to `su01-new-approver.html`.
    - **Glasses (Display):** Navigates to `su01-old-approver.html`.
    - **Blank Page (Create):** Shows an "Access Denied" error bar.
- **Logic:** The agent must type the User ID (e.g., MJONES) into the field first, then click the **Pencil** icon to proceed.

#### **2. Refactor Navigation (The "OK-Code" Logic)**
In all pages (`su01-old`, `su01-new`, `zv-table`), update the Command Field (top left):
- Typing `SU01` or `/nSU01` must **always** route to `su01-initial.html` (the blank entry screen), never directly to a specific user.
- Typing `/nZV_T16FW` must route to the delegation table filter screen.

#### **3. Standardize the "SAP Toolbar" Component**
Ensure every page uses the same toolbar div structure so the agent’s "Click Pencil" or "Click Save" skills are transferable.
- **Save (💾):** Used for committing changes.
- **Back (⬅️):** Returns to the previous screen.
- **Exit (❌):** Logs out to `sap-login.html`.
- **Cancel (🚫):** Clears the current screen.

#### **4. State Management (sessionStorage)**
- When the agent types a User ID in `su01-initial.html`, save it to `sessionStorage.setItem('targetUser', value)`.
- The subsequent pages should read this value to display the correct data. This ensures the agent is actually "controlling" the system rather than just following a script.

#### **5. Replace Browser Alerts with SAP Message Bars**
- Any "Unknown T-code" or "Success" message must appear in the **Status Bar** at the bottom of the SAP window (a 25px high grey bar with a small icon). The agent must be trained to "read" this bar to confirm its actions were successful.

***

### **Summary of the "Real" Workflow for the Agent:**
1. **Login**
2. **Type `/nSU01`** in Command Field.
3. **Wait** for `su01-initial.html` to load.
4. **Type `MJONES`** in the User field.
5. **Click the Pencil Icon** on the toolbar.
6. **Assign Roles** and **Click the Save (💾) Icon**.
7. **Read Status Bar** for "User MJONES saved".

**Verdict:** Update the existing files. It’s the fastest way to get the "muscle memory" right without wasting time on CSS you’ve already built.
